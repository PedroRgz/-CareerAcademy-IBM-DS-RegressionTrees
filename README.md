# CareerAcademy-IBM-DS-RegressionTrees

Practicing regression trees with large dataset

## Description

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that I used to practice regression trees as part of a course. The goal was to predict taxi tips using a large dataset provided by the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). I explored both Scikit-Learn and Snap ML libraries for model training and evaluation.

## Introduction

In this exercise session, I consolidated my machine learning (ML) modeling skills by using a popular regression model: Decision Tree. I used a real dataset to train such a model. The dataset includes information about taxi tips and was collected and provided to the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) by technology providers authorized under the Taxicab & Livery Passenger Enhancement Programs (TPEP/LPEP). I used the trained model to predict the amount of tip paid.

During this exercise, I practiced not only the Scikit-Learn Python interface but also the Python API offered by the Snap Machine Learning (Snap ML) library. Snap ML is a high-performance IBM library for ML modeling. It provides highly-efficient CPU/GPU implementations of linear models and tree-based models. Snap ML not only accelerates ML algorithms through system awareness but also offers novel ML algorithms with best-in-class accuracy. For more information, please visit [Snap ML](https://www.zurich.ibm.com/snapml/).

## Installation

To install the necessary libraries, use the following commands:

```bash
pip install snapml==1.8.2
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PedroRgz/CareerAcademy-IBM-DS-RegressionTrees.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
    ```bash
    cd CareerAcademy-IBM-DS-RegressionTrees
    ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Regression_Trees_SnapML.ipynb
    ```
4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to run the code cells and train the regression models.
